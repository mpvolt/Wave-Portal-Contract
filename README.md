# Wave-Portal-Contract
Record and Display people who wave ðŸ‘‹  at me on the Rinkeby Blockchain

The main branch repository contains the Replit code that creates a web browser for users to interact with the smart contract

The other branch contains the actual smart contract code, and a script for redeploying the smart contract to the Rinkeby testnet :)
